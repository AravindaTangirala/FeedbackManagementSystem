# This is a small MERN feedback maanagement system Project

# It consists of 3 pages .First page user inputs the user name , coursename and rating of the tutorial they have taken

# Once submit button is clicked it will redirect them to the second page which dispalys teh original informatoon entered by user along with a text box to provide additional comments

# Once user enters the additional comments and clicks submit button it will redirect them to teh summary page where we can see all the details entered by different users

# Front end client is run on 3000 port (local host)

# Backend is liestening on port 5000

# For this project we need to istall the following dependencies

# nodemon (not a mandatory but helpful to auto restart server after changes in teh file )

# mongoose to work with mongoDB

# Express to work with nodeJS

# axios for CRUD operations

# cors because our front end liestening on port 3000 needs to communicate with backend liestening on port 5000

# body-parser to parse the data inside body

# We are using router-dom to navigate from one page to other.
